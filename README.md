# Supply Chain Performance Analysis
Supply chain performance analysis conducted for Lineas, the largest private rail freight operator in Europe. 
The case was done under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), hence only a high-level view of the project is presented here, and no code nor report is presented.

Under the supervision of Intys, a consulting company, our group had to apply a rigorous methodology to tackle a real-case data analysis of a logistics company: Lineas.
The objective was to identify through data analysis potential problems or bottlenecks in Lineas’ supply chain resulting in losses (or opportunity costs) for the company. 

In a nutshell, we had to
-	Use the data provided: Lineas’ past rail freight transports, assets allocation, and internal documents.
-	Clean the data.
-	Manipulate the data (data analysis) to reveal/identify problems in their logistics using PowerBI and incorporate them in a root cause analysis.
-	Come up with countermeasures and a plan for implementing them (steps, RACI table, Gantt charts, and KPIs).
-	Create a monitoring dashboard to monitor the progress  - quantified by the KPIs defined - of the countermeasures proposed.

Our group successfully identified core problems in their asset turnover, production performance, and cancellation reasons, and proposed solutions in order to increase the company’s profits.
